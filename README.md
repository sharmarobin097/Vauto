# Vauto

1. Java 8 is required at minimun because I am using Java 8 features. 
2. This is a Spring Boot project. Maven is used as a build tool. Import as existing maven project in your IDE.
3. This application contains an embedded server and can be run as a java application. 
4. You can run as a Java application from your IDE after performing a build or use the executable JAR in the target folder. 
5. Copy vauto-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar to your favorite folder or run this command directly from the target folder: java -jar vauto-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar. Java might have to be added to OS path.
